Make is typically used to build executable programs and
libraries from source code. Generally though, Make is
applicable to any process that involves executing arbitrary
commands to transform a source file to a target result.
For example, Make could be used to detect a change made to
an image file and the transformation actions might be to
convert the file to some specific format, copy the result
into a content management system, and then send e-mail to
a predefined set of users indicating that the above actions
were performed.
