In software development, Make is a build automation tool that
automatically builds executable programs and libraries from
source code by reading files called Makefiles which specify
how to derive the target program. Though integrated development
environments and language-specific compiler features can also
be used to manage a build process, Make remains widely used,
especially in Unix and Unix-like operating systems. Besides
building programs, Make can be used to manage any project
where some files must be updated automatically from others
whenever the others change.
