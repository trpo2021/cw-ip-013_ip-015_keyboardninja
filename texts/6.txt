Make can decide where to start through topological sorting.
Each command line must begin with a tab character to be
recognized as a command. The tab is a whitespace character,
but the space character does not have the same special meaning.
This is problematic, since there may be no visual difference
between a tab and a series of space characters. This aspect
of the syntax of makefiles is often subject to criticism;
it has been described by Eric S. Raymond as "one of the worst
design botches in the history of Unix".
