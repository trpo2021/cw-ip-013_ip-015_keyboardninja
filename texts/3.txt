Git is software for tracking changes in any set of files, usually
used for coordinating work among programmers collaboratively
developing source code during software development. Its goals
include speed, data integrity, and support for distributed,
non-linear workflows. Git was created by Linus Torvalds in 2005
for development of the Linux kernel, with other kernel developers
contributing to its initial development. Since 2005, Junio Hamano
has been the core maintainer.
