In statistics, Cochrans C test, named after William G. Cochran,
is a one-sided upper limit variance outlier test. The C test is
used to decide if a single estimate of a variance is significantly
larger than a group of variances with which the single estimate
is supposed to be comparable. The C test is discussed in many
text books and has been recommended by IUPAC and ISO. Cochrans C
test should not be confused with Cochran's Q test, which applies
to the analysis of two-way randomized block designs.
