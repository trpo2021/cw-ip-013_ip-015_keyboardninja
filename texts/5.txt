As Git is a distributed version-control system, it could
be used as a server out of the box. Its shipped with a
built-in command git daemon which starts a simple TCP server
running on the GIT protocol. Dedicated Git HTTP servers help
by adding access control, displaying the contents of a Git
repository via the web interfaces, and managing multiple
repositories. Already existing Git repositories can be cloned
and shared to be used by others as a centralized repo. It
can also be accessed via remote shell just by having the
Git software installed and allowing a user to log in.
